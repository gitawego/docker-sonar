Docker Image for Sonarqube
==========================

It uses the offical sonarqube image now and installs selected plugins into
a data-only container.

Just use docker-compose to run as normal i.e. ``docker-compose up -d``

NOTE: To rebuild the plugin container you have to use ``docker-compose build``

SSH into sonarQube
=============
```
docker exec -i -t container_id /bin/sh
```
